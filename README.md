- Explanation of Sachin ML Assginment 1:

- Step 1. *Import necessary libraries:

- pandas: For data manipulation and creation of DataFrames.
- numpy: For numerical operations (though not strictly necessary here, it's often used).
- train_test_split from sklearn.model_selection: To split the dataset into training and testing sets.
- LinearRegression from sklearn.linear_model: To create the linear regression model.
- mean_squared_error from sklearn.metrics: To evaluate the model's performance.

- Step 2. Create a sample dataset:

- A dictionary data is defined with YearsExperience and Salary.
The dictionary is then converted into a DataFrame using pd.DataFrame().

- Step 3. Define features and target variable:

- X represents the feature (independent variable) which is YearsExperience.
- y represents the target variable (dependent variable) which is Salary.

- Step 4. Split the data into training and testing sets:

- The train_test_split function is used to split the data into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.
random_state=42 ensures that the split is reproducible.

- Step 5. Create and fit the linear regression model:

- An instance of LinearRegression is created.
The model is fitted using the training data with the fit method.

- Step 6. Make predictions on the test set:

- The predict method is used to make predictions on the test data (X_test).

- Step 7. Calculate Mean Squared Error:
- mean_squared_error computes the MSE between the actual values (y_test) and the predicted values (y_pred).

- Step 8. Print the results:
- Output the MSE to evaluate the modelâ€™s performance.

 - Explanation of Sachin ML Assignment 2:

- Step 1.Import Necessary Libraries: In python import pandas as pd from sklearn.datasets import load_iris

- Purpose: Import the pandas library, which is essential for data manipulation and analysis, and load_iris from sklearn.datasets to access the Iris dataset.

- Details: pandas is used to handle data in DataFrame format, which simplifies various data operations, while load_iris provides a convenient way to load the Iris dataset.

- Step 2. Load the Iris Dataset: python iris = load_iris()

- Purpose: Load the Iris dataset into the variable iris.

- Details: The load_iris function returns a dictionary-like object containing the data, feature names, and other metadata about the Iris dataset.

- Step 3.Convert to DataFrame: python iris_df = pd.DataFrame(data=iris.data, columns=iris.feature_names)

- Purpose: Convert the data from the Iris dataset into a pandas DataFrame named iris_df.

- Details: iris.data contains the feature data, and iris.feature_names provides the column names. This conversion makes it easier to manipulate and analyze the data using DataFrame methods.

- Step 4. Display the First Five Rows: python print("First five rows of the dataset:") print(iris_df.head())

- Purpose: Display the first five rows of the DataFrame to get a preview of the dataset.
Details: head() is a DataFrame method that returns the first five rows. This helps in quickly understanding the structure and content of the dataset.

- Step 5.Display the Shape of the Dataset: python print("\nShape of the dataset:") print(iris_df.shape)

- Purpose: Show the dimensions (number of rows and columns) of the DataFrame.
- Details: shape is an attribute of the DataFrame that returns a tuple representing the number of rows and columns. This provides a quick overview of the dataset size.

- Step 6.Display Summary Statistics: python print("\nSummary statistics of the dataset:") print(iris_df.describe())

- Purpose: Provide summary statistics for each feature in the DataFrame.

- Details: describe() is a DataFrame method that computes summary statistics such as mean, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum values for numerical columns.This helps in understanding the distribution and range of feature values.
